    "Regression Analysis: Building Models to Predict Store Sales Using Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Time series forecasting involves making scientific predictions by analyzing historical data with timestamps. This process entails constructing models through a detailed examination of past data, which are then utilized to make informed projections, guiding future strategic decision-making. It's important to recognize that during the forecasting process, the future outcome is entirely unknown and can only be approximated through meticulous analysis and evidence-based assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to predict product unit sales across various stores, aiming to enhance inventory management, refine marketing strategies, and optimize pricing decisions for Favorita Corporation. To achieve this objective, we employ a combination of time series analysis and regression-based machine learning algorithms within the CRISP-DM framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis seeks to identify the most effective prediction model from a diverse set of machine learning algorithms tested. The chosen model will be recommended to Favorita Corporation, providing valuable insights to facilitate informed decisions regarding retail sales, promotional activities, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging time series regression analysis, we aim to achieve a robust and reliable forecast of store sales, thereby supporting strategic planning and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "HYPOTHESIS TESTING \n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The predictive model does not significantly improve the accuracy of unit sales forecasts for products at Favorita stores compared to a baseline model (e.g., a naive forecast using historical averages or a simple moving average).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The predictive model significantly improves the accuracy of unit sales forecasts for products at Favorita stores compared to a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS\n",
    "1.Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?\n",
    "2.Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days the store was closed)?\n",
    "3.Compare the sales for each month across the years and determine which month of which year had the highest sales.\n",
    "4.Did the earthquake impact sales?\n",
    "5.Are certain stores or groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)\n",
    "6.Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?\n",
    "7.What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?\n",
    "8.Which product family and stores did the promotions affect.\n",
    "9.What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)\n",
    "10.Does the payment of wages in the public sector on the 15th and last days of the month influence the store sales.\n"
